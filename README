This is the base metadata, used bny met.no for the wdb system.


Updating metadata
=================

Metadata may be added by modifying the files under etc/. Each file
contains sql statements for inserting metadata into the database.

As a general rule, you should never remove or modify metadata from
these packages. If a need for modifying metadata arises, you must make
sure to check that it works properly before distributing those
changes.

The files in the etc/ folder are:

wdbMetadata.in.sql 
------------------

Controls loading of other files. You should
normally not need to edit this file.

wdb_namespace.in.sql
--------------------

Namespace definitions.


wdb_dataprovider.in.sql
-----------------------

List of dataproviders. contains calls to functions wci.addDataprovider
and wci.addDataproviderToGroup. Note that these calls are dependent on
a prior correct invocation of wci.begin.

Signatures:

wci.addDataprovider(
    dataprovidername_ text, -- Name of dataorvider
    dataprovidertype_ text, -- "data provider group", "computer system" or "wci user"
    domaindelivery_ text,  -- "any", "grid" or "point"
    lifecycle_ interval, -- deprecated - should normally be "1 day"
    dataprovidercomment_ text -- Any comments, for documentation purposes
)

addDataprovider adds or updates a dataprovider.

wci.addDataproviderToGroup(
    dataprovidername_ text, -- provider to add
    dataprovidergroup_ text -- group to add provider to
)

a dataprovider group is just a dataprovider, with
dataprovidertype="data provider group".


wdb_parameter.in.sql
--------------------

Parameter definitions. Description to be added.


wdb_party.in.sql
----------------

May be ignored for now.


wdb_placepoint.in.sql
---------------------

Named points in space. All point data in the database must be related
to a placepoint. 

The names of points have a period they are valid for. This means that
the same name may mean different things at different times. Normally
valid to should be infinity, but you may later change this in the
metadata if you wish.

Signature:

wci.addorupdateplacepoint(
    placename_ text, -- name of the point, in the current namespace, as set by wci.begin
    placegeometry_ geometry,  -- WKT definition of the point (for example "POINT(11 59)")
    placevalidfrom_ timestamp with time zone, -- The name is valid from this time
    placevalidto_ timestamp with time zone -- after this time, the name is invalid.
)


wdb_spatial_ref_sys.in.sql
--------------------------

Information about a projection used in the database.

Signature:

wci.addsrid(
    authname_ text, -- A description of who may use this projection
    projection_ text -- the proj4 definition of the projection
)


wdb_placeregulargrid.in.sql
---------------------------

Named grids. All gridded data in the database must be connected to a grid definition.

Note that most loading programs may automatically create these grid
definitions, but if you want a particular name for a grid, or if the
loading program is buggy, you must add this to the metadata.

Signature:

wci.addplaceregulargrid(
    placename_ text, -- name of the grid
    numx_ integer, -- number of points in the x direction
    numy_ integer, -- number of points in the y direction
    incx_ double precision, -- distance between points in the projection's units, in the x direction
    incy_ double precision,  -- distance between points in the projection's units, in the x direction
    startx_ double precision, -- starting x coordinate, in projection's units
    starty_ double precision, -- starting y coordinate, in projection's units
    projection_ text -- proj4 definition. This must have been added in wdb_spatial_ref_sys.in.sql before usage here
)



Creating debian packages to update metadata
===========================================

In short:

First time:
> autoreconf -i
> ./configure

* Update configure.ac with a new version number under AC_INIT(...)
* Update debian_files Package tag, if big version change.
> dch -c debian_files/changelog -vNEW_VERSION-1 -m"very short description"
> make debian

Make sure to test that installation works fine before distributing.
