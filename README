WDB is a database system for storage and retrieval of weather and 
water observations and forecasts. It handles both gridded data
(raster) and point data. 


Installation
============

Please refer to the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.

Requirements
------------

WDB requires that a PostgreSQL installation is installed and available. 
In addition, it requires the following libraries:
	* postgis (www.postgis.org)
	* grib-api (www.ecmwf.eu/products/data/software/grib_api.html)
	* boost (www.boost.org)
	* log4cpp (log4cpp.sourceforge.net)
	* proj.4 (proj.maptools.org)
	* GNU Readline (tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)
	
The following technologies are also used, if present:
	* CppUnit (cppunit.sourceforge.net)
	* xmlto   (www.docbook.org)
	* doxygen (www.doxygen.org)

The configuration script should be able to locate these libraries if 
they are installed on your system. If the script has difficulty 
locating the libraries, you may assist it by explicitly specifying the
directories for the configure script. For more information about this, 
run:

	./configure --help


Requirements when installing
----------------------------

If the install procedure fails, please note the following:

- A postgresql database must be up and running before installation is
  attempted. The user running the installation script must have rights
  to create a new database on the DBMS.

- Installation will fail if AUTOVACUUM is not turned on (from 
  PostgreSQL 8.3, this is the default). Please refer to the postgresql 
  documentation for details on autovacuum and how to turn it on.

- Installation of the database will fail if you attempt to install the
  database twice. If you need to overwrite the old installation, you
  must first remove the old version of the database.


Other useful make targets
----------------------------

As stated in the INSTALL notes, ./configure; make; make install handles
the compilation and installation of the WDB system (provided the 
requirements stated above are fulfilled). The following make targets 
may also be of interest.

- uninstall
  Uninstall the WDB system.
  
- html
  Generates html-based documentation for WDB utilizing docbook.
  
- pdf
  Generates documentation for WDB in PDF format utilizing docbook.

- doxygen-doc
  Generates developer documentation for the WDB source code using 
  doxygen.

- check
  Runs the WDB unit tests. 

- installcheck
  Runs the WDB install tests. These verify that you have a correctly 
  functioning installation of WDB. They require that you have  
  successfully installed WDB on the system.

- performancecheck

  working installation of WDB.
