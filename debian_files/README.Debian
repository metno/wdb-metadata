WDB Metadata in Debian
==============

This doc file needs to be corrected.

WDB is a database system designed to store meteorological,
hydrological and oceanographic (MHO) data in a PostgreSQL database
management server. The purpose of the WDB system is to improve the
quality and effectiveness of IT systems for MHO production by
providing a flexible and effective data storage solution for real-time
and archive data.


Nonstandard installation
------------------------

In order to get a basic wdb database up and running, just install the
package, and you should be ok. If you want to use a specific setup,
such as a nonstandard database name, or a nonstandard administrator
user name, you are ok, too. In this case you may use dbconfig-common,
through debian's regular configuration system (dpkg-preconfigure).

However, dbconfig-common does not know about database clusters. This 
means that:

1: If the installed computer has more that one database cluster,
   installation will fail.
2: If you want to do anything nonstandard about your cluster, you must
   do it yourself, manually.

In order to set up a new specific cluster with data located in the
folder /somewhere/var/lib/hindcast/, you may do the following:

1: pg_dropcluster --stop 8.1 main
2: pg_createcluster 8.1 main -d /somewhere/var/lib/hindcast \
       -s /var/run/hindcast --start

WARNING: This will destroy all other postgres databases on the
computer, so you may want to find another way of doing this.

If you absolutely need to use multiple clusters, you can create a
cluster manually, and then install the database manually on the new
cluster. 

Here is an example of how to set up a database hindcast, running on
its own cluster, with the database's data located in the folder
/somewhere/var/lib/hindcast/.

1. su wdb -c uninstall-database
2. adduser wdb --disabled-password --gecos 0
3. su wdb -c 'echo "8.1 hindcast hindcast" > $HOME/.postgresqlrc'
4. pg_createcluster 8.1 hindcast -d /somewhere/var/lib/hindcast -s /var/run/hindcast -u wdb -g wdb --start
5. echo -e "database = hindcast\nhost = /var/run/hindcast\nport = 5433" > /etc/wdb.conf
6. su wdb -c install-database

Comments:

2: This creates a database administrator. Currently, the name *must*
   be wdb.

3: This sets default database to a database called hindcast in a
   cluster with the same name, running on postgresql v. 8.1.

4: Creating and starting the cluster.

5: This is the database configuration. Note that the port number must
   match the port number assigned by pg_createcluster (which will be
   printed on stdout). If you wish, you may instead place the file in
   wdb's $HOME/.wdb/wdb.conf, but then only the wdb user will be able
   to run any local applications related to wdb.



Users
-----

The previous example showed how to set up the database locally. In
order to access it, you also need to create user accounts. Here is an
easy way to do this. It requires that you are the wdb user. 

WARNING: The following is not good security-wise, since it allows
*anyone* to log into the database.

1. psql -c "CREATE ROLE wcireader INHERIT LOGIN IN ROLE wdb_read"
2. echo "host    hindcast    wcireader   127.0.0.1/0           trust" >> /etc/postgresql/8.1/hindcast/pg_hba.conf
3. <<Change /etc/postgresql/8.1/hindcast/postgresql.conf listen_addresses to '*'>>
4: pg_ctlcluster 8.1 hindcast restart

This will create a role, wcireader, which is only allowed to read from
the database. Anyone may log in as this role, from anywhere in the
world.


Loading data
------------

Programs for loading data into the database is placed in
/usr/lib/wdb. These are not run autmatically, so you must yourself
invoke these programs when needed.
