Template: wdb/metadata_name
Type: string
Default: wdb
_Description: The wdb database name:
 The name of the wdb database that this package should upgrade. Note that 
 this debian package only supports one wdb installation per server. If 
 you wish to use multiple databases on a single server, you will need
 to perform the installation manually.

Template: wdb/metadata_admin
Type: string
Default: wdb
_Description: The wdb administrator account:
 This is the username for administration of the wdb database. It is 
 assumed that this user has already been created by the wdb package.

Template: wdb/metadata_purge
Type: boolean
_Description: Do you want to purge the metadata?
 Purge the metadata if you want to remove the metadata in the database
 installed by this package. Note that - due to the nature of the metadata
 in wdb - a complete purge of the package is not possible. Purging the
 metadata will remove all namespaces associated with this package; it can
 not roll back changes to the canonical metadata domain that may have been
 caused by this package.
 .
 If you do not purge the metadata, it will remain in its current state on
 the database server. In other words, removing this package will have no
 practical effects on wdb beyond cleaning out the installation scripts.
